    OWASP Dependency Check Suppression File

    This file suppresses FALSE POSITIVES only - never real vulnerabilities.
    Each suppression must be documented with clear justification.

    Before adding a suppression, verify:
    1. The CVE does not apply to this library
    2. The CPE match is incorrect (wrong product/vendor)
    3. Document why it's a false positive

        FALSE POSITIVE: bucket4j_jdk17-postgresql

        bucket4j is a Java rate limiting library (https://bucket4j.com/).
        OWASP incorrectly associates PostgreSQL DATABASE SERVER CVEs with this
        Java library because "postgresql" appears in the artifact name.

        Evidence this is false positive:
        - bucket4j 8.16.0 released in 2024
        - CVEs listed are from 2014-2021 for PostgreSQL server
        - bucket4j is a Java library, not the PostgreSQL database
        - CPE shows cpe:2.3:a:postgresql:postgresql:8.16.0 which is wrong
          (treating JAR version as PostgreSQL server version)

        See: https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/1529
             (Similar false positive issue with PostgreSQL JDBC driver)
